## 2026-04-20 — Project kickoff

### Decisions
- **Supabase hosted** (not local). User creates the project and pastes env vars when migrations are ready.
- **Pattern A for data access.** All app-path reads/writes go through the `@supabase/ssr` client so RLS enforces tenancy. Prisma is used for: TypeScript types, structural schema (kept in sync via `prisma db pull` after migrations), and the seed script (running as the service role, bypassing RLS).
- **Supabase CLI is the migration source of truth.** Hand-written SQL lives in `/supabase/migrations/*.sql`. Prisma schema is regenerated from the DB, not the other way around.
- **`package.json` scripts:**
  - `db:migrate` → `supabase db push`
  - `db:generate` → `prisma db pull && prisma generate`
  - `db:seed` → `tsx supabase/seed.ts` (uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
  - `db:reset` → `supabase db reset`
- **Order numbering extended:** `organizations` gains two columns beyond the spec — `order_prefix text` (default `upper(left(slug, 2))`) and `order_seq_start int default 1000`. `generate_order_number(uuid)` uses a dedicated `org_order_seq(org_id PK, next_seq int)` row locked with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, returning `greatest(next_seq, max(existing_order_seq) + 1, order_seq_start)` and writing back `next_seq + 1`. Both fields are editable in Settings → Shop.
- **Google OAuth** is wired in code but will return a provider-not-configured error until the user enables it in their Supabase dashboard. Email+password is the tested path.

### Assumptions
- Node 24 and pnpm 10 are fine for Next 14 App Router. If we hit a compatibility issue I'll flag it.
- Neutral color + New York variant for shadcn/ui. Accent color (`#4A5D7E`) applied via CSS variable override after `shadcn init`.
- Invite links are unsigned UUIDs — not cryptographically strong, but good enough for Task 1 (no email delivery yet). DEFERRED: upgrade to signed tokens or one-time codes when email is wired up.

### Sub-step 1 — scaffold (complete)
- Next 14.2.35, React 18.3.1, TS 5.9.3, Tailwind 3.4.19
- `tsconfig.json` tightened: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, `target: ES2022`
- `.eslintrc.json` enforces: no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-nocheck`, no `console.log` (warn/error allowed), type-only imports
- `lint` script uses `--max-warnings 0` so warnings fail the check
- **Note:** first commit `da920cb` was accidentally authored as "Claude <claude@example.local>" because I set a local git config before realizing the user had a global identity. Local override has been unset. `git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit` will fix authorship if you want it.

### Sub-step 2 — deps + shadcn (complete)
- **Pinned `shadcn@2.10.0`** instead of `@latest`. The current npm `@latest` tag resolves to `shadcn@4.3.1`, which is a major rewrite that swaps Radix UI for `@base-ui/react` and uses a preset-based theming system incompatible with the spec's "neutral base color" language. v2.10 matches the design target (Radix primitives, CSS variables, new-york style, base-color neutral). Revisit only if we intentionally migrate to shadcn 4.x.
- **Tailwind / CSS var format fix.** shadcn 2.10's `init --defaults` writes CSS vars as `oklch(...)` but left the scaffolded `tailwind.config.ts` with `hsl(var(--X))` wrappers, which would render as `hsl(oklch(...))` — invalid CSS. Rewrote the Tailwind config to reference `var(--X)` directly. Also added the missing `--destructive-foreground` var that Button and Badge both reference.
- **Brand accent.** Added `--brand` / `--brand-foreground` CSS vars (stone slate blue, computed in OKLCH from #4A5D7E ≈ `oklch(0.46 0.04 252)` light / `oklch(0.72 0.04 252)` dark) and a `brand` color in Tailwind. Focus ring (`--ring`) is bound to the same color. `--primary` intentionally kept as dark neutral — Linear/Ramp feel, one accent used sparingly.
- **Fonts.** Inter + JetBrains Mono via `next/font/google` as `--font-sans` / `--font-mono`. Removed the scaffold's local Geist `.woff` files.
- **Components added** (in `components/ui/`): button, input, label, textarea, select, dialog, sheet, table, badge, tabs, command, dropdown-menu, avatar, form, skeleton, separator, checkbox, tooltip, popover, calendar, scroll-area, alert-dialog, sonner.
- **Root layout.** `ThemeProvider` (next-themes, class attr, light default) + `Toaster` (sonner wrapper, top-right, rich colors) mounted in `app/layout.tsx`. `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` for the theme class swap.
- **`.gitignore`** tightened to ignore `.env` and `.env.*` with `!.env.example` exception.
- **`lucide-react@1.8.0`** — confirmed via `npm view` that lucide-react shipped 1.x in late 2025, so this is the correct modern version (not a fork or typo).
- **pnpm build** passes cleanly (5 static routes, ~96 kB first-load JS on `/`).

### Deferred
- Signed/expiring invite tokens (tracked for when email is wired)
- Automated tests (explicitly out of scope for Task 1)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- CSP / security headers beyond Next defaults
- Avatar/logo image resizing (we'll accept upload and use as-is)
- Real-time subscriptions (Supabase Realtime) for kanban — optimistic updates only for now
