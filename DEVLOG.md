## 2026-04-20 — Project kickoff

### Decisions
- **Supabase hosted** (not local). User creates the project and pastes env vars when migrations are ready.
- **Pattern A for data access.** All app-path reads/writes go through the `@supabase/ssr` client so RLS enforces tenancy. Prisma is used for: TypeScript types, structural schema (kept in sync via `prisma db pull` after migrations), and the seed script (running as the service role, bypassing RLS).
- **Supabase CLI is the migration source of truth.** Hand-written SQL lives in `/supabase/migrations/*.sql`. Prisma schema is regenerated from the DB, not the other way around.
- **`package.json` scripts:**
  - `db:migrate` → `supabase db push`
  - `db:generate` → `prisma db pull && prisma generate`
  - `db:seed` → `tsx supabase/seed.ts` (uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
  - `db:reset` → `supabase db reset`
- **Order numbering extended:** `organizations` gains two columns beyond the spec — `order_prefix text` (default `upper(left(slug, 2))`) and `order_seq_start int default 1000`. `generate_order_number(uuid)` uses a dedicated `org_order_seq(org_id PK, next_seq int)` row locked with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, returning `greatest(next_seq, max(existing_order_seq) + 1, order_seq_start)` and writing back `next_seq + 1`. Both fields are editable in Settings → Shop.
- **Google OAuth** is wired in code but will return a provider-not-configured error until the user enables it in their Supabase dashboard. Email+password is the tested path.

### Assumptions
- Node 24 and pnpm 10 are fine for Next 14 App Router. If we hit a compatibility issue I'll flag it.
- Neutral color + New York variant for shadcn/ui. Accent color (`#4A5D7E`) applied via CSS variable override after `shadcn init`.
- Invite links are unsigned UUIDs — not cryptographically strong, but good enough for Task 1 (no email delivery yet). DEFERRED: upgrade to signed tokens or one-time codes when email is wired up.

### Sub-step 1 — scaffold (complete)
- Next 14.2.35, React 18.3.1, TS 5.9.3, Tailwind 3.4.19
- `tsconfig.json` tightened: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, `target: ES2022`
- `.eslintrc.json` enforces: no `any`, no `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-nocheck`, no `console.log` (warn/error allowed), type-only imports
- `lint` script uses `--max-warnings 0` so warnings fail the check
- **Note:** first commit `da920cb` was accidentally authored as "Claude <claude@example.local>" because I set a local git config before realizing the user had a global identity. Local override has been unset. `git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit` will fix authorship if you want it.

### Sub-step 2 — deps + shadcn (complete)
- **Pinned `shadcn@2.10.0`** instead of `@latest`. The current npm `@latest` tag resolves to `shadcn@4.3.1`, which is a major rewrite that swaps Radix UI for `@base-ui/react` and uses a preset-based theming system incompatible with the spec's "neutral base color" language. v2.10 matches the design target (Radix primitives, CSS variables, new-york style, base-color neutral). Revisit only if we intentionally migrate to shadcn 4.x.
- **Tailwind / CSS var format fix.** shadcn 2.10's `init --defaults` writes CSS vars as `oklch(...)` but left the scaffolded `tailwind.config.ts` with `hsl(var(--X))` wrappers, which would render as `hsl(oklch(...))` — invalid CSS. Rewrote the Tailwind config to reference `var(--X)` directly. Also added the missing `--destructive-foreground` var that Button and Badge both reference.
- **Brand accent.** Added `--brand` / `--brand-foreground` CSS vars (stone slate blue, computed in OKLCH from #4A5D7E ≈ `oklch(0.46 0.04 252)` light / `oklch(0.72 0.04 252)` dark) and a `brand` color in Tailwind. Focus ring (`--ring`) is bound to the same color. `--primary` intentionally kept as dark neutral — Linear/Ramp feel, one accent used sparingly.
- **Fonts.** Inter + JetBrains Mono via `next/font/google` as `--font-sans` / `--font-mono`. Removed the scaffold's local Geist `.woff` files.
- **Components added** (in `components/ui/`): button, input, label, textarea, select, dialog, sheet, table, badge, tabs, command, dropdown-menu, avatar, form, skeleton, separator, checkbox, tooltip, popover, calendar, scroll-area, alert-dialog, sonner.
- **Root layout.** `ThemeProvider` (next-themes, class attr, light default) + `Toaster` (sonner wrapper, top-right, rich colors) mounted in `app/layout.tsx`. `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` for the theme class swap.
- **`.gitignore`** tightened to ignore `.env` and `.env.*` with `!.env.example` exception.
- **`lucide-react@1.8.0`** — confirmed via `npm view` that lucide-react shipped 1.x in late 2025, so this is the correct modern version (not a fork or typo).
- **pnpm build** passes cleanly (5 static routes, ~96 kB first-load JS on `/`).

### Sub-step 3 — database schema (complete pending user env vars)
- **Prisma downgraded 7.7.0 → 6.19.3.** Prisma 7 removed `url` / `directUrl` from `datasource` and now requires a separate `prisma.config.ts` with adapter or accelerateUrl. That is a much larger API rewrite than makes sense to fight during Task 1; pinning to 6.19.3 (latest 6.x) keeps the familiar schema config and matches every tutorial / example. Revisit only if we deliberately migrate to Prisma 7.
- **Migrations (5 files).** Tables, enums, indexes, RLS helpers in 0001; full RLS policies + field-role column-guard trigger in 0002; `generate_order_number()` with `FOR UPDATE` + `greatest(next_seq, max existing, order_seq_start)` in 0003; `balance_due` trigger in 0004; storage bucket + RLS + all audit triggers (activity_log + order_stage_history) in 0005. Every audit trigger function is `SECURITY DEFINER` so it bypasses the otherwise-empty INSERT policies on `activity_log` and `order_stage_history`.
- **Postgres enums for stage / priority / role / attachment_kind** instead of CHECK constraints on text — Prisma and Supabase's TS codegen both surface Postgres enums as narrow union types.
- **`order_prefix` default.** A BEFORE INSERT trigger fills `order_prefix` when the caller leaves it blank, using `upper(left(regexp_replace(slug, '[^a-zA-Z]', '', 'g'), 2))`. Settings → Shop will surface the value so shops can override.
- **Field-role column enforcement** done via `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that raises `42501` if the caller's role is `field` and any column other than `stage` / `notes` changed. Postgres RLS can't express column-level permissions.
- **`org_order_seq`** is closed behind empty RLS + the `SECURITY DEFINER` `generate_order_number` function, so app code cannot touch it directly.
- **Storage path convention** `{org_id}/{order_id}/{uuid}-{filename}` is enforced by RLS on `storage.objects` using `(storage.foldername(name))[1]::uuid` → `is_org_member()`.
- **Seed (`supabase/seed.ts`).** Idempotent: deletes the existing `top-marble-granite` org + demo user, then creates fresh. Demo login `owner@topmarble.local` / `StoneDemo!2026`. Org slug `top-marble-granite` with **explicit `order_prefix='TM'`** and `order_seq_start=1042` so the first order is `TM-1042` matching the spec example. 8 customers + 10 orders distributed across every stage, realistic stone types and edge profiles.
- **`prisma.seed` scripts.** `db:generate` (generate client only), `db:pull` (introspect from DB), `db:migrate` (`supabase db push`), `db:reset` (`supabase db reset`), `db:seed` (`tsx --env-file=.env.local supabase/seed.ts`). A `postinstall: prisma generate` keeps the client up to date on fresh clones.
- **`lib/db.ts`** is a Prisma singleton — used only by the seed and any future service-role jobs. Server actions must not import it (RLS would be bypassed).
- **Not applied yet.** Files exist but nothing has run against a real Supabase project. User action required: create project, paste env vars, install Supabase CLI, `supabase link --project-ref <ref>`, `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:seed`.

### Deferred
- Signed/expiring invite tokens (tracked for when email is wired)
- Automated tests (explicitly out of scope for Task 1)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- CSP / security headers beyond Next defaults
- Avatar/logo image resizing (we'll accept upload and use as-is)
- Real-time subscriptions (Supabase Realtime) for kanban — optimistic updates only for now
